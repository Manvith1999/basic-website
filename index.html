    Edward the Elder[a] (c.‚Äâ874 ‚Äì 17 July 924) was the King of the Anglo-Saxons from 899 until his death in 924. He was the elder son of Alfred the Great and his wife Ealhswith. When Edward succeeded to the throne, he had to defeat a challenge from
    his cousin √Üthelwold, who had a strong claim to the throne as the son of Alfred's elder brother and predecessor, √Üthelred I.<br />
    Alfred had succeeded √Üthelred as king of Wessex in 871, and almost faced defeat against the Danish Vikings until his decisive victory at the Battle of Edington in 878. After the battle, the Vikings still ruled Northumbria, East Anglia and eastern
    Mercia, leaving only Wessex and western Mercia under Anglo-Saxon control. In the early 880s √Üthelred, Lord of the Mercians, the ruler of western Mercia, accepted Alfred's lordship and married his daughter √Üthelfl√¶d, and around 886 Alfred adopted
    the new title King of the Anglo-Saxons as the ruler of all Anglo-Saxons not subject to Danish rule. Edward inherited the new title when Alfred died in 899.

  <hr>
  Historians dispute how far Mercia was dominated by Wessex during this period, and after √Üthelfl√¶d's death in June 918, her daughter √Ülfwynn briefly became second Lady of the Mercians, but in December Edward took her into Wessex and imposed direct
  rule on Mercia. By the end of the 910s he ruled Wessex, Mercia and East Anglia, and only Northumbria remained under Viking rule. In 924 he faced a Mercian and Welsh revolt at Chester, and after putting it down he died at Farndon in Cheshire on 17
  July 924. He was succeeded by his eldest son, √Üthelstan. Edward's two youngest sons later reigned as kings Edmund I and Eadred.
